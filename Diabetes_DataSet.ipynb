    "A dataset is a collection of information (or data) that can be used by a computer. A dataset typically has some number of examples, where each example has features associated with it. Some datasets also include labels, which is an identifying piece of information that is of interest.\n",

    "What is an example?\n",
    "---\n",
    "An example is a single element of a dataset, typically a row (similar to a row in a table). Multiple examples are used to generalize trends about the dataset as a whole. When predicting the list price of a house, each house would be considered a single example.\n",

If your examples are houses, your features might be: the square footage, the number of bedrooms, or the number of bathrooms. Some features are more useful than others. When predicting the list price of a house the number of bedrooms is a useful feature while the color of the walls is not, even though they both describe the house.\n",
